# CardGame (Texas Hold'Em - Java Edition)
**Version: 0.02 (Pre-Alpha)**

This project strives to create a version of Texas Hold'Em purely in the language of Java. The game is currently in a state where it can be played off a command line, but nothing more. It is still very buggy and features still need to be added. *In theory* though, a game is totally possible. A GUI is expected to be added later, but until it can be only played on a command line, and I have only been testing through my IDE (IntellIJ Idea), so nothing is guaranteed.

## How to Play
The command line gives instructions on how to play.
